  Leprechaun Dolphins is a powerful system with the potential to serve as a
  standard in event coordination. It noticeably increased the
  effectiveness of events. The software checks every step of
  your progress and tells you what's going wrong in each
  event. It suggests changes you can make in your company,
  without penalizing you. The level of interactivity every
  step of the way made this, at least for me, a very powerful
  coordinating tool. Over time, I found myself actually
  looking forward to planning events.
